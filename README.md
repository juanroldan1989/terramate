### Infrastructure Layers

- **01-networking/**: Foundation layer containing VPCs, subnets, security groups and network ACLs
- **02-compute/**: Compute resources including ECS clusters, EKS clusters and auto-scaling groups
- **03-applications/**: Application-specific services and resources built on top of compute and networking

## Key Components

- **Terraform Modules**: Reusable infrastructure components sourced from the [infra-modules](https://github.com/juanroldan1989/infra-modules) repository
- **Terragrunt Framework**: Handles environment configuration and orchestrates infrastructure provisioning
- **Terramate**: Provides advanced stack management and CI/CD integration capabilities

## Documentation
- **[Infrastructure Setup & Usage](README.md#setup)** - Getting started with Terramate, Terragrunt and Terraform
- **[Drift Detection Strategy](DRIFT.md)** - Comprehensive drift monitoring across environments and regions
- **[Disaster Recovery Documentation](enterprise/DR.md)** - Multi-region failover capabilities and procedures

## Infrastructure
- **[Enterprise Environments](enterprise/)** - Production-ready infrastructure across dev/qa/prod environments
  - **[Development](enterprise/dev/)** - US-based development infrastructure (us-east-1, us-west-1)
  - **[QA](enterprise/qa/)** - EU testing environment (eu-west-1)
  - **[Production](enterprise/prod/)** - EU production infrastructure (eu-central-1)
- **[Architecture Overview](ARCH.md)** - Multi-region, multi-account enterprise infrastructure designed for scaling to hundreds of components with built-in disaster recovery.

## Automation & CI/CD
- **[GitHub Actions Workflows](.github/workflows/)** - Automated infrastructure management
  - **[Infrastructure Preview](.github/workflows/infra-preview.yaml)** - PR-based change validation
  - **[Infrastructure Provisioning](.github/workflows/provision-infra.yaml)** - Automated deployment to production
  - **[Drift Detection Workflows](.github/workflows/)** - Multi-environment drift monitoring support for on-demand and scheduled runs (`drift-detection-<env>.yaml` files).

## Configuration
- **[Terramate Configuration](terramate.tm.hcl)** - Stack management and orchestration
- **[Root Configuration](root.hcl)** - Shared Terragrunt configuration and AWS provider setup
- **[Bootstrap Scripts](bootstrap/)** - Initial infrastructure setup utilities

## Provision infrastructure

### For `dev/us-east-1`

```ruby
# enterprise/dev/us-east-1

./infra-management.sh apply
```

### For `dev/us-west-1`

```ruby
# enterprise/dev/us-west-1

./infra-management.sh apply
```

### For `dev/global/failover`

```ruby
# enterprise/dev/global/failover

terragrunt run apply
```

## Delete infrastructure

### For `dev/us-east-1`

```ruby
# enterprise/dev/us-east-1

./infra-management.sh destroy
```

## Sync stacks on Terramate - Steps

1. Install CLIs: `terragrunt`, `terraform` and `terramate`
2. import existing Terragrunt modules (modules with a state backend configuration) as Terramate stacks:

```ruby
terramate create --all-terragrunt
```

This command detects your existing Terragrunt modules, creates a stack configuration in each of them

and automatically sets up the **order of execution** using the **before** and **after** attributes based on detected Terragrunt dependencies.

3. List all Stacks:

```ruby
terramate list
```

4. Set required ENV variables for Terragrunt:

```ruby
export AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=xxxxxx
```

5. Initialize Terraform with Terragrunt:

```ruby
terramate run -- terragrunt init
```

6. Create a Terraform Plan with Terragrunt in Parallel:

```ruby
terramate run --parallel 5 -- terragrunt plan -out plan.tfplan
```

7. Apply a Terraform Plan with Terragrunt in Changed Stacks:

```ruby
terramate run --changed -- terragrunt apply -auto-approve plan.tfplan
```

8. Create a GitHub Personal Access Token for Terramate Cloud sync:

- Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
- Click "Generate new token (classic)"
- Give it a descriptive name like "Terramate Cloud Sync"
- Set an appropriate expiration date
- Select the following scopes:
  - **`repo`** - Full control of private repositories (includes public repos)
  - **`read:org`** - Read org and team membership (if using organization repos)
- Export the token as an environment variable:

```ruby
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_personal_access_token_here
```

9. Sync Terragrunt modules provisioned as **stacks** in Terramate:

```ruby
terramate run \
  --continue-on-error \
  --cloud-sync-drift-status \
  --terraform-plan-file=drift.tfplan \
  --terragrunt \
  -- terragrunt plan -out drift.tfplan -detailed-exitcode -lock=false
```

- The easiest way to sync your stacks is to run a drift detection workflow in all stacks and sync the result to Terramate Cloud.

- The command above runs a `terragrunt plan` in all your stacks and sends the result to Terramate Cloud.

- This works because Terramate CLI extracts data such as metadata, resources, Git metadata and more from the created plans and the environment in which it's running, sanitizes it locally and syncs the result to Terramate Cloud. **This makes Terramate extremely secure** since no sensitive information, such as credentials or certificates, will ever be synced to Terramate Cloud.
